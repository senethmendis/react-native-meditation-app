## About

Meditation App is a cross-platform mobile application built with React Native that aims to help users find peace and mindfulness through meditation. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced meditator, this app provides a wide range of tools to enhance your practice.

The app includes guided meditations, breathing exercises, and customizable meditation plans that cater to different needs such as reducing stress, improving sleep, and boosting focus. Users can track their progress, set reminders, and even download content for offline use, ensuring that they can maintain their practice no matter where they are.
